# Arduino Mega Based JFET Meter

Here you can find firmware sources for Arduino Mega 2560 board,
and a Python script for a host computer, to measure main
parameters of N-JFET transistors. The script communicates with
Mega board via USB serial port, sends commands, receives the results
of the measurements, saves the results to JSON and PNG files,
draws a diagram on the display.
